# Readme
Sample python app that uses FASTAPI framework and PostgresSQL database.
The main goal here is to:
1. Create simple REST API with FASTAPI that can be used to create, read, and delete recipes.
2. Run the app as a Docker container.
3. Use Docker Compose to create and start both app and db in one command.
4. Using Minikube to create local Kubernetes cluster and run the app there as a pod.
